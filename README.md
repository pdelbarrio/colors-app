# Colors-App

Color Application to practice React and some libraries.

## What is all about?

▶ You can click on any small palette. This will open the corresponding large palette that includes all its colors.

▶ In each large palette you have a slider with which you can modify the color level from lighter to darker.

▶ You also have a drop-down menu where you can choose the color format (Hexadecimal, RGB and RGBA).

▶ Depending on the color level and format chosen you can copy the color code by clicking on each color.

▶ When you click on it, a transition of the chosen color is activated, confirming that the code has been copied in the clipboard.

▶ You can also click on "MORE" to see a gradation of each color and copy the color code too.

▶ Libraries used: Material-UI, react-router-dom, react-copy-to-clipboard, chroma-js, rc-slider.
